Hopt-o-mex is currently an incomplete Haskell port of my "opt-o-mex" c++ optimal control software.

So far I've implemented euler/rk4 integrators, dynamics linearization functions, differential dynamic programming using automatic differentiations from Edward Kmett's ad package, and a few examples.

For a quick demo of ddp run springDdp.hs
